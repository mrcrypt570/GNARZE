# PRELUDE TO GNARZE

Welcome to the Prelude to Gnarze choose-your-own-adventure book!

This story was made for fun and in homage to similar stories like Zork and Lone Wolf.
It’s also interactive with its own combat and ability check systems (like Lone Wolf).
While I did put more than a little bit of work into it, please don’t take this too seriously.
It’s kind of campy (maybe obnoxious) on purpose.

Make sure you have python3 installed, then run PlayGnarze.py in terminal to play!
Follow the prompts to choose your own adventure - your decisions and skill checks change the story!

The outcome of some decisions depend on a skill check (STATCHK) against Jorgen's skill values.
Succeeding a dexterity check (dxx) or perception check (prr) could help you go first during combat,
collect Healing Potions that you can use during combat, find special items, or even change the story.

Combat pauses the story and sets you as the spectator watching Jorgen and his opponents fight.
If you have a Healing Potion, you'll decide whether or not to use it at the beginning of each round.
As with life, the story goes on if you survive.

To start the game with a Healing Potion, put 'p' in the items array in Jorgen's character file (JORGEN.py).

The PDF version will soon be available on my selfsploitationpress . net space.
Grab a pen or pencil and a six-sided die and have a read!

Thank you very much for playing.
